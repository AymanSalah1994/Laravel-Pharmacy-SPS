1- Making the Command File : 
    ~$ php artisan make:command create

2- In "app\Console\Commands\create.php" << "The Newly Created File " : 
    A - We Added the Code For the Command To Handle and Signature 
    B - Check "2.1-step2_Sample_Code.txt"

3-This Code still Need Some Refactor Like "Cheking the Email Exist OR not in the DB and Other Stuff " 
    - Maybe Also Displaying "info" is a Better Way Using "->info()" Method  ;
