Using the AdminLTE : 
    - The Resources "Dependencies" we Need are [ dist & plugins ] Folders 

1- Take BOTH and Put them in the "public" folder In the laravel project 
        # By putting them in Public folder you Can access them Using "asset()"
        Helper Function 
        # Note : There are So Many Assets Files But For Now Keep them All !


2- The General Rule "According to the PDF ":
    All views must be divided into sub directories Like posts/index.blade.php
     : Each Tab [ For each Model ] Has a Views Folder For its Own CRUD operations 

3- For Now One DashBoard View is Made : 
    - Supposed to Make a "Navigation" Component For each ROLE/USER 

I will Start Now with Permissions Since it is related to those "NAVIGATIONS" Tabs 


## ALL WHAT WE NEED is the "starter.html" File !!! And Related assets !
