Users in the System  : 
    [
        1- Admin  ; 
        2- Pharmacy 
        3- Doctor 
        4- User "Customer"
    ] << One Model Or Many ???

Roles vs Permissions : 
    -

===============================================
THE MODELS ISSUE !!!!
    _ Many Conflicts in Models and Permissions and what they Do Or don't !! 
    Even His Record Conflict with the PDF and with the General Idea !!

    Anyways : 
        There are 2 Approaches : 
            A - One User Model  , With a Column To Specify Role 
                Related Data Can Come Since We always Can Know Who is the "User" Currently ! 
            
            B_ Multiple Models For each User ,, and we will Need to Modify Some Stuff For 
            the Auth Guard Specally All of Them "Login" To the System 
            So We will Need then To Make Multiple models , All of Then Can Login and Assign then Roles to them 
        
            C - Only The Ordinary User Model , 
            And This Model is PolyMorphic To multiple Other "MODELS"!!!

        I WILL work on the PolyMorphic Solution !!!

REMEBER : it is ALL about Business LOGIC !
===============================================
First Of All We will Install the Package ,then Make the DB and Tables Changes and Some tweaks  ;
