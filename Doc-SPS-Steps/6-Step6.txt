We Have {
    Admin  -> His Own Model
    Pharmacy -> His Own Model
    Doctor ->  His Own Model
    User -> Will Use the Normal Model 
}

$ php artisan make:model Admin -m 
    - Model and Migration 

$ php artisan make:model Pharmacy -m

$ php artisan make:model Doctor -m 
    - Model and Migration 
=============
I had to Edit the "AdminSeeder" For the New Morph Thing ; 
I made it "nullableMorphs" For Seeding , and i Might Use it Directly For the API  ; 

Now i added the Three Roles [ Admin , Doctor , Pharmacy]
    - I will Start Testing the "Permission" and Roles Package ;
