Laravel Permissions : 
    $ composer require spatie/laravel-permission 

    $ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider"

    Now We Need To Migrate again :
        $ php artisan migrate
            [ To Be more Precise :~$ php artisan migrate:fresh]
    This will Add the Permissions Table and Roles and Those stuff  For Us ;  
    The Models are in thr Package For Us "In use Spatie\Permission\Models\Role" For Example 


# We will Need Also to add "HasRoles" Trait to User Model  ; 

# We will Need To Make "Roles" Seeder Before Using Them : 
    1- $ php artisan make:seeder RolesSeeder
    2- Fill in the Seeder Class Code ; 
    3- 

Roles is Tested and Working "Tried With Pharmacy and Admin For Now  "
    And i made a Pharmacy Seeder also 
    I will Make a Doctor Seeder Also 

Now I will Start Making the "Navigation For EACH Role " and Based On that 
    - I will Start Making the CRUDS for Models
